  While Unit Testing is a common practice in most modern programming languages, SQL practitioners do not commonly create or use Unit Tests, and there does not seem to be an accepted standard practice for creating and using Unit Tests. A great part of the reason for this is the difficulty involved in creating and maintaining Mock Data.
</p>
<h2>This article introduces:</h2>
  <ol>
	<li>Techniques and a framework for Unit Testing using SQL stored procedures and transactions with no external framework or Mock Data required.</li>
	<li>Additionally, the resultant test procedures may be left in place as a test harness for production code.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>
  Why Unit Test:
</h2>
<p>
  Unit Testing objects accomplishes several important tasks:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<u>A well written Unit Test serves as an acceptance test for an object</u>. If the Unit Test adequately describes the required functionality, and it passes, the object under test is acceptable. This does NOT remove the requirement for general best practices such as clarity in code and documentation from the programmer, but it does make the job of functional testing much more straight forward.
	</li>
	<li>
		<u style="font-size: 12.8px;">A well written Unit Test allows the object under test to be readily refactored</u>
		<span style="font-size: 12.8px;">. The ability to refactor objects almost at will is a core tenet of modern programming. However, without a Unit Test to validate existing functionality, and that the existing functionality is not compromised by the refactoring, refactoring is rarely performed. Unit tests allow an object to be written as simply as possible to meet the current requirements, with the knowledge that it can easily be refactored in the future to meet additional requirements as long as the existing Unit Tests continue to pass.</span>
	</li>
</ol>
<h2>Note:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Normal error handling techniques are not included in the test objects for clarity.</li>
		<li>The process demonstrated here assumes implementation by an experienced professional aware of the application on which it is implemented. Examples include, but are not limited to, avoiding external access such as sending objects to a queue or via smtp. In other words; common sense is assumed to prevail.</li>
	</ol>
<h2>Process:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		<u>Create a procedure to test the target object</u>. By convention, I prefer to name the test procedure as 
		<em>[&lt;schema&gt;_test].[&lt;object&gt;]</em> where 
		<em>[&lt;schema&gt;].[&lt;object&gt;]</em> is the object to be tested. For example, to test a procedure 
		<em>[account].[get_primary]</em> I will create a test procedure named 
		<em>[account_test].[get_primary]</em>. This technique of grouping the tests by convention in schemas named with the &quot;
		<em>_test</em>&quot; extension facilitates automated testing (see Automated Testing header below).
	</li>
	<li></li>
</ol>

<h2>
	Create Test Objects and Data:
</h2>
	<p>To demonstrate, we will need some data for testing. The script below will create and populate a working table with some sample data. We are going to use a calculated column to get the age from a date of birth. We will write Unit Tests both for mutator and accessor methods as well as to validate the calculated column.</p>
<h2>
  Create Procedures To Be Tested:
</h2>
<p>
  Now that we have data, we need to create procedures to access and mutate the data. These will then need to be tested. You can refer to these as accessor/mutator or getter/setter procedures.
</p>
<h2>
  Automated Testing:
</h2>
<p>
  Automated testing can be implemented if the conventions defined here are followed. The most important two are naming, grouping tests in schemas named with the &quot;
	<em>_test</em>&quot; extension, and the use of the 
	<em>@output [xml]</em> parameter with defined nodes.

</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<u>Naming convention</u>. Using a naming convention for tests as&nbsp;
		<em style="font-size: 12.8px;">[&lt;schema&gt;_test].[&lt;object&gt;]</em>
		<span style="font-size: 12.8px;">&nbsp;where&nbsp;</span>
		<em style="font-size: 12.8px;">[&lt;schema&gt;].[&lt;object&gt;]</em>
		<span style="font-size: 12.8px;">&nbsp;is the object to be tested allows security constraints as well as ready identification of tests for specific objects.</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size: 12.8px;">Defined 
			<em>@output [xml]</em> parameter. Implementation of a defined&nbsp;
		</span>
		<em style="font-size: 12.8px;">@output [xml]</em>
		<span style="font-size: 12.8px;">&nbsp;parameter both allows automated testing&nbsp;</span>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Implementing a test runner such as 
	<em>[master].[dbo].[sp_run_test]</em> allows tests to be run programmatically in any database when the conventions above are followed.
