##SQL Tools and Utilities. 
This is a collection of SQL tools and utilities that I've developed since beginning to work with SQL Server in 1997. Some of them are relatively mature objects, some of them are presentations or boilerplate code. In some cases I have implemented rather esoteric techniques simply to show or to discover how they would work.

I am a SQL Server professional experienced in the design, development, administration of Microsoft SQL Server and SQL Server objects. I am quality conscious and self-motivated with extensive experience working in a team environment and an inclination for lifetime learning. I have worked extensively with Agile methodologies to ensure business requirements are met within business constraints for costs and time. I maintain a personal repository of code used for training, presentations, and prototypes including specific functions and techniques.

I am also experienced in broader scope scripts and prototypes for documentation and analysis of databases, schemas, objects, workflow, and others. My experience includes presentation and training in both complex and commonplace SQL Server technologies as well as consulting in and recommendation of solutions to meet specific business requirements. I maintain an open source Transact SQL framework. I use this platform for demonstration of advanced techniques and tools, development and prototypes, and presentations.

I have been a software engineer for thirty years. I spent three years in the late 1980's building databases in ANSI C as, at the time, Oracle Database and the language of SQL were still in their commercial infancy and were both slow and their future was unknown. I built the databases to support the development of an Artificial Intelligence (Expert System) application for the Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining.

I have worked with relational databases since 1997, both Oracle Database and SQL Server. I became a Microsoft Certified Database Administrator (MCDBA, the highest certification offered by Microsoft on SQL Server at the time) on SQL Server 2000 in 2000 and have worked with all versions since SQL Server 6.5. In the past five or six years I have worked exclusively with SQL Server. I have built both transactional Operational Data Stores and Data Warehouses. I have both designed and implemented and upgraded existing OLTP and OLAP environments. I have developed and delivered training to colleagues and peers on best practices and techniques for the language of SQL and for SQL Server.

I enjoy creating and building systems to meet business objectives. I enjoy the process of designing and deploying well architected systems to meet business objectives and am comfortable with a "white sheet" approach to design where there are no substantive existing objects and the architect must envision and design an architecture where none existed before. I have been a manager, technical lead, and data architect. I am most comfortable in the role of technical lead and data architect. That said, as a contractor for the last five or six years I have spent a lot of time working simply as a contributing member of the team and am comfortable doing so.
