SQL Tools and Utilities. This is a collection of SQL tools and utilities that I've developed since beginning to work with SQL Server in 1997. Some of them are relatively mature objects, some of them are presentations or boilerplate code. In some cases I have implemented rather esoteric techniques simply to show or to discover how they would work.
